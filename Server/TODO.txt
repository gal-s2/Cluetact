- clueGiverId is not a good name, we need to change it to clueGiverUsername
- change naming convening of waiting rooms from lobbyId to waitingRoomId
- add mechanism to send and show error messages to clients
- word length should be visible? (ask ido for a tiebreaker)
- location api
- facebook google authentication
- deploy!
- emojis 

GAME:
- handle the bug where a user can guess its own definition
- add suggestions for word with external api
- in the end, avoid using the word inside the definition
- block definitons and word if not using letters (special chars not allowed, trim spaces, check if included)
-change the way that the seeker guesses, convert it an action line with an option to choose the defintion

DATABASE:
- think about which attributes to save on a User in db (wins etc.)
- need to put the dtabase in the cloud in google cloud/aws/atlas database

Simple tasks to-do:
1. convert the set notification to a smarter notification, instead of 1 paramater it will get 2:
color and message (red = error, green = success, black = normal notification)
2. remove the cluetact crazy pop-up 3-seconds message on cluetact and make it on the normal notification bar
3. try and make notifications being able to not switch one other, but rather be one under one (if too many - 'fold')

notes from friens who played the game:
-when there is a white mode, it looks weird
-the box of marking the guess is not looking good in desktop
-remove the number of letters in the word to avoid confusion
-change it to turns of the seekers
-change the words api, it doesnt work good (it doesnt accept words like "monday","margaret")
